is nppended by Hau to his edition, nnd by him
intituled the Continnntion os Trivet. This
nnme is very apt to mislend. The work treats,
indeed, of the history of the successor of Ed-
word 1.; bnt its oompiler, besides being known
hy others as the anonymous Continuntor of Mut-
thew os Paris, ie, in the style, arrangement, and,
we may add, quality, different from, and so in-
ferior to our author, that it has been judged
advisnhle ω give the Annnls of Trivet entire,
nnd tao reserve the other anonymons work for
another occasion, when it may be more appro-
printely included among the numerous short,
and, in three instanees, nnonyrnous ohroniclers
of the reign of Edwnrd 11.

§6. In conclusion, nll that now remeius sore-mannen
the Editor, is, the grateful task os alluding to
the advantages received by this edition in its
passing through the prees of Messrs. Bentley
nnd Co. To them he has to express his obli-
gation ; but in a particular manner to the leam-
ed person who superintends their reading depart-
ment. Few know what labour aud minuteness
nre required where so mnny MSS. have been
oonsulted, end to this Gentleman the Editor is
iudehted not only sor his patient indnstry aud
nonteness, hut also sor some anuable readings
when it hes been judged expedient to amend
the text.
